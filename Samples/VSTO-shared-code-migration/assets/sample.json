        "Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) add-ins can only run in Office for Windows. By migrating your code to an Office web add-in, you can expand the reach of your add-in to mobile and online platforms. Migrating the code will require it to use the Office JavaScript APIs. However, you can reduce migration cost by creating a shared library and keeping some of your existing add-in code in its current language."
