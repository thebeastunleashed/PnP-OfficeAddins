**Note:** This sample is archived and no longer actively maintained. Security vulnerabilities may exist in the project, or its dependencies. If you plan to reuse or run any code from this repo, be sure to perform appropriate security checks on the code or dependencies first. Do not use this project as the starting point of a production Office Add-in. Always start your production code by using the Office/SharePoint development workload in Visual Studio, or the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office), and follow security best practices as you develop the add-in.

### Summary ###
This sample demonstrates mail add-in for Outlook which extracts data from a mail message and retrieves data from Office 365 APIs. Node.js is used for server side code, AngularJS for front-end and for authentication purposes Adal.js + Azure AD. Additionally(not required to run) there is .NET WebApi project to show how we can retrieve data from custom REST APIs. (projectUrl)

### Applies to ###
-  Outlook on Office 365 (outlook.office365.com) - Google Chrome

### Prerequisites ###
-  Office 365 Developer Subscription. See [Sign up for an Office 365 Developer Subscription and set up your tools and environment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/fp179924.aspx)
-  Must have an Office 365 developer site. See [How to: Create a Developer Site within your existing Office 365 subscription](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj692554.aspx)
-  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) environment (locally for development, Azure can be used for production)
- [Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com) account is required - you will need to configure Azure Active Directory for this sample. See [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](https://github.com/AzureADSamples/SinglePageApp-AngularJS-DotNet#step-2--register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant)
- Optionally: you will run .NET WebApi project to show additional sample data (seen on picture as Reports, Employees) as an example how we can consume external REST APIs. Use this [agile9.outlook.context.db - Code First Entity Framework 6.0 Sample Project With Data](https://github.com/matejv1/agile9.outlook.context.db)

# Mail Addin For Outlook Using Office 365 APIs #
This code sample demonstrates the use of an add-in for Outlook for showing additional data to user from Office 365 APIs and custom REST APIs.

## 1. Building this sample ##
This sample consists of 3 primary components:

1. Node.js server side code - running locally (can be hosted anywhere, Azure for example fully supports Node.js architecture)
2. Add-In for Office Manifest - defines how our add-in is activated within Outlook
3. Front-end code - HTML markup and AngularJS JavaScript for interacting with the server-side API


### 1.1 Configure Azure Active Directory ###

This is already well documented. See [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](https://github.com/AzureADSamples/SinglePageApp-AngularJS-DotNet#step-2--register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant)

Note:
1. Make sure you create Key
2. make changes to Manifest file (Download, oauth2AllowImplicitFlow: true, Upload back)
3. give an app required permissions (Exchange, SharePoint Online)

### 1.2 Configure App Settings ###

1. Open project location in Explorer. Open src/app.routes.js
2. Change tenant name (replace "agile9" with your Office 365 tenant name)

### 1.3 Install Node.js Dependecies ###

1. Open source location on local computer using Explorer. 
2. Open Command Prompt in this folder (Hold SHIFT + Right click -> Open Command Windows here)
3. Run: npm install

### 1.4 Upload Office Manifest to Exchange ###

1. Navigate to portal.office.com
2. Select Admin
3. In the left side menu select ADMIN -> Exchange
4. On Exchange admin center page select "add-ins" under "organization" group
5. Select Add from File and upload manifest

### 1.5 Running the sample

1. Follow steps in 1.2 to navigate to right location using CMD
2. Run: npm start
3. Open in Chrome browser: https://localhost:8443/#/ 
4. Accept SSL warning (certificate is not verifed by know authority)
5. Open https://outlook.office365.com and see the result

### 1.6 Hosting/Running this sample in Azure 

1. You will need to replace server.js with content from server-production.js. 
2. For the rest you should follow this article [Build and deploy a Node.js web app in Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-nodejs-develop-deploy-mac/?utm_content=buffer1e07e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)
