# Use keyboard shortcuts for Office add-in actions

## Summary

This sample shows how to set up a basic Excel add-in project that utilizes keyboard shortcuts. Currently, the shortcuts are configured to show and hide the task pane as well as cycle through colors for a selected cell. Keyboard shortcuts can be used to achieve any action within the add-in runtime.

----------

## Scenario: Open/Close taskpane and modify cell color

This sample adds three different shortcuts to the Office Add-in. This enables the user to:

- Use the "Ctrl+Alt+1" keyboard shortcut to open the task pane.
- Use the "Ctrl+Alt+2" keyboard shortcut to close the task pane.
- Use the "Ctrl+Alt+3" keyboard shortcut to cycle through colors for a selected cell.
- Use the "Ctrl+R" keyboard shortcut to test the shortcut conflict modal.

## Run the sample

You can run this sample in Excel in a browser. The add-in web files are served from this repo on GitHub.

1. Download the **manifest.xml** file from this sample to a folder on your computer.
1. Open [Office on the web](https://office.live.com/).
1. Choose **Excel**, and then open a new document.
1. Open the **Insert** tab on the ribbon and choose **Office Add-ins**.
1. On the **Office Add-ins** dialog, select the **MY ADD-INS** tab, choose **Manage My Add-ins**, and then **Upload My Add-in**.
   ![The Office Add-ins dialog with a drop-down in the upper right reading "Manage my add-ins" and a drop-down below it with the option "Upload My Add-in"](../../Samples/images/office-add-ins-my-account.png)
1. Browse to the add-in manifest file, and then select **Upload**.

1. Verify that the add-in loaded successfully. You will see a **PnP keyboard shortcuts** button on the **Home** tab on the ribbon.

Once the add-in is loaded use the following steps to try out the functionality.

1. Press "Ctrl+Alt+1" on the keyboard to trigger the Show Taskpane action.
2. In the task pane, you will see the additional shortcuts available to try in the sample.

## Key parts of this sample

The manifest.xml is pre-configured to use the shared runtime. To see how to add shared runtime to your own add-in, use the following article:

- [Configure your Excel Add-in to use a shared JavaScript runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/excel/configure-your-add-in-to-use-a-shared-runtime)


Additionally, the following changes have been made to enable keyboard shortcuts:

1. Configured the add-in's manifest by adding the new element `ExtendedOverrides` to the end of the manifest.
2. Created the shortcuts JSON file `shortcuts.json`, in the `src/` folder to define actions and their keyboard shortcuts.
3. Mapped actions to runtime calls with the associate method in `src/taskpane.js`.


## Run the sample from Localhost

If you prefer to host the web server for the sample on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Open the **/src/commands/ribbonJSON.js** file.
1. Edit line 9 to refer to the localhost:3000 endpoint as shown in the following code.
    
    ```javascript
    const sourceUrl = "https://localhost:3000";
    ```
    
1. Save the file.
1. You need http-server to run the local web server. If you haven't installed this yet you can do this with the following command:
    
    ```console
    npm install --global http-server
    ```
    
2. Use a tool such as openssl to generate a self-signed certificate that you can use for the web server. Move the cert.pem and key.pem files to the webworker-customfunction folder for this sample.
3. From a command prompt, go to the web-worker folder and run the following command:
    
    ```console
    http-server -S --cors . -p 3000
    ```
    
4. To reroute to localhost run office-addin-https-reverse-proxy. If you haven't installed this you can do this with the following command:
    
    ```console
    npm install --global office-addin-https-reverse-proxy
    ```
    
    To reroute run the following in another command prompt:
    
    ```console
    office-addin-https-reverse-proxy --url http://localhost:3000
    ```
    
5. Follow the steps in [Run the sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins/tree/main/Samples/excel-keyboard-shortcuts#run-the-sample), but upload the `manifest-localhost.xml` file for step 6.
