They use Excel to do analysis on the data, or other types of number crunching. Then they upload the data back to the web site. Instead of multiple steps to export the data from the web site to a .csv file, import the .csv file into Excel, work with the data, then export it from Excel, and upload it back to the web site, we can simplify this process to one button click.",
