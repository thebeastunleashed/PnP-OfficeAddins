# Insert an external Excel file and populate it with JSON data

## Summary

This sample shows how to insert an existing template from an external Excel file into the currently open Excel file. Then it retrieves data from a JSON web service and populates the template for the customer.

## Features

- Use **insertWorksheetsFromBase64** to insert a worksheet from another Excel file into the open Excel file.
- Get JSON data and add it to the worksheet.

## Applies to

- Excel on Windows, Mac, and on the web.

## Prerequisites

To use this sample, you'll need to [join Office Insider](https://insider.office.com/join).

## Run the sample

To run the sample you just need to sideload the manifest. The add-in web files are served from this repo on GitHub.

1. Download the **manifest.xml** and **SalesTemplate.xlsx** files from this sample to a folder on your computer.
1. Open [Office on the web](https://www.office.com/).
1. Choose **Excel**, and then open a new document.
1. Select the **Insert** tab, and choose **Office Add-ins**.
1. On the **Office Add-ins** dialog, select **MY ADD-INS** , choose the **Manage My Add-ins** drop-down, and then choose **Upload My Add-in**.

    ![The Office Add-ins dialog with a drop-down in the upper right reading "Manage my add-ins" and a drop-down below it with the option "Upload My Add-in"](../../Samples/images/office-add-ins-my-account.png)

1. Browse to the add-in manifest file, and then select **Upload**.

    ![The upload add-in dialog with buttons for browse, upload, and cancel.](../../Samples/images/upload-add-in.png)

1. Verify that the add-in loaded successfully. You'll see a **PnP Insert Excel file** button on the **Home** tab.

Once the add-in is loaded, use the following steps to try out the functionality.

1. On the **Home** tab, choose **PnP Insert Excel file**.
1. In the task pane, select the **Choose file** button.
1. In the dialog box that opens, select the **SalesTemplate.xlsx** file that you downloaded previously, and choose **Open**.

A **Contoso Sales Report** will be inserted with a table and chart populated with data.

## Key parts of this sample

When you select the **SalesTemplate.xlsx** file, the following code in **index.js** inserts the template. It sets up an object named **options** to identify the sheet by name (**Template**). Then it calls the Office.js **insertWorksheetsFromBase64** API to insert the template into the current worksheet.

```javascript
// STEP 1: Insert the template into the workbook.
const workbook = context.workbook;

// Set up the insert options.
const options = {
  sheetNamesToInsert: ["Template"], // Insert the "Template" worksheet from the source workbook.
  positionType: Excel.WorksheetPositionType.after, // Insert after the `relativeTo` sheet.
  relativeTo: "Sheet1",
}; // The sheet relative to which the other worksheets will be inserted. Used with `positionType`.

// Insert the external worksheet.
workbook.insertWorksheetsFromBase64(workbookContents, options);
```

Next, it gets the JSON which is in the **data.json** file in this repo.

```javascript
// STEP 2: Add data from the "Service".
const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("Template");

  // Get data from your REST API. For this sample, the JSON is fetched from a file in the repo.
  let response = await fetch(dataSourceUrl + "/data.json");
  if (response.ok) {
    const json = await response.json();
  } else {
    console.error("HTTP-Error: " + response.status);
  }
```

Finally, it adds the JSON to the table.

```javascript
// Map JSON to table columns.
  const newSalesData = json.salesData.map((item) => [
    item.PRODUCT,
    item.QTR1,
    item.QTR2,
    item.QTR3,
    item.QTR4
  ]);

  // We know that the table in this template starts at B5, so we start with that.
  // Next, we calculate the total number of rows from our sales data.
  const startRow = 5;
  const address = "B" + startRow + ":F" + (newSalesData.length + startRow - 1);
      
  // Write the sales data to the table in the template.
  const range = sheet.getRange(address);
  range.values = newSalesData;
  sheet.activate();
```

## Run the sample on localhost

If you prefer to host the web server for the sample on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Open the **index.js** file.
1. Edit line 4 to refer to the localhost:3000 endpoint as shown in the following code.

    ```javascript
    const dataSourceUrl = "https://localhost:3000";
    ```

1. Save the file.
1. You need http-server to run the local web server. If you haven't installed http-server, you can do this with the following command:

    ```console
    npm install --global http-server
    ```

1. Use a tool such as openssl to generate a self-signed certificate that you can use for the web server. Move the cert.pem and key.pem files to the webworker-customfunction folder for this sample.
1. From a command prompt, go to the web-worker folder and run the following command:

    ```console
    http-server -S --cors . -p 3000
    ```

1. To reroute to localhost run office-addin-https-reverse-proxy. If you haven't installed this proxy, you can do it with the following command:

    ```console
    npm install --global office-addin-https-reverse-proxy
    ```

    To reroute run the following in another command prompt:

    ```console
    office-addin-https-reverse-proxy --url http://localhost:3000
    ```

1. Follow the steps in [Run the sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins/tree/main/Samples/excel-keyboard-shortcuts#run-the-sample), but upload the `manifest-localhost.xml` file for step 6.
